# Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations and examples of various design patterns commonly used in software development.

## Overview

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered during software design and development. They provide templates and guidelines for solving specific issues in a structured and efficient manner.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are typically categorized into three main types:

- **Creational Patterns:** These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, aiming to provide more flexible and intuitive ways to create objects.
  
- **Structural Patterns:** Structural patterns focus on class composition and object structure, emphasizing relationships between objects to form larger, more complex structures.
  
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Behavioral patterns concentrate on object collaboration and communication, defining how objects interact with each other and how their behaviors are encapsulated.
